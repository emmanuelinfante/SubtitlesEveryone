This repository allows you not only to create subtitles in a completely unlimited and free manner, but also allows you to:

- üåç You can translate your subtitle with more than 20 translators! With the help of **[Translators!](https://pypi.org/project/translators)**

- ![](https://github.com/emmanuelinfante/SubtitlesEveryone/blob/main/mini%20deepl.png) Translate your subtitle with DeepL completely free and unlimited, with the help of **[SrtTranslators!](https://pypi.org/project/srtranslator/)**
- üé∑ Improve the [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) transcription with the help of **[Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs)**, extract the vocals, and no longer have any errors with Vad!

### Improvements to WhisperX with the help of Demucs üé∑
We have noticed that WhisperX has very serious errors when VAD is used in oriental languages. This is because VAD cannot differentiate between non-voice sounds and voice, causing it to end up eliminating sections where there is voice. The solution to this is to use Demucs to extract the voice, and with this, the transcription improves significantly, in any language.

### Translators as subtitle translator 
Originally, Translatros was not created to translate subtitles; however, we adapted the code for subtitle translation, which allows you and anyone else to translate subtitles into many languages, with over 20 translators, and completely free of charge ü•≥
